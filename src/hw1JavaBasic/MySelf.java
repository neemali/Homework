There are two types of naming conventions for project, package and class in Java.
1. Camel case. & 2. Snake case.
 Under the Camel case feature- beginning  from the second word, 
the first letter of each word is upper case.
Example: project: January2022CoreJava
                 package: lec01JavaBasics
                 class: NamingConventions
The rules of the Snake case feature are- Beginning from the second word,
each word is lower case. Also, the space between each word is replaced with the 
underscore sign. 
Example: project: January_2022_core_java 
              package: lec01_java_basics
              class:Naming_conventions
Regardless of the chosen feature another rule is 
for project and class the first word starts with upper case 
and
for package the first word starts with lower case
